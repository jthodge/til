# Look Up DNS with `host`

Instead of taking a trip to the registrar to look up the DNS for a domain, use the `host` command instead.

```terminal
host github.com
github.com has address 140.82.112.3
github.com mail is handled by 1 aspmx.l.google.com.
github.com mail is handled by 10 alt3.aspmx.l.google.com.
github.com mail is handled by 10 alt4.aspmx.l.google.com.
github.com mail is handled by 5 alt1.aspmx.l.google.com.
github.com mail is handled by 5 alt2.aspmx.l.google.com.
```
