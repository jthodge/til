1. Open DevTools with `⌘ + ⌥ + i` or by inspecting a specific element.

2. Open the command menu with `⌘ + Shift + P`.

3. Type "_screenshot_" in the command menu.

4. Capure the screenshot for your preferred view.

There are four view options for capturing screenshots:

- "_Capture area screenshot_" allows you to capture a given area using a height/width selection tool.

- "_Capture full size screenshot_" will capture the full, entire page.

- "_Capture node screenshot_" will capture a screenshot of the currently selected DOM node.

- "_Capture screenshot_" will capture the currently visible page area.
