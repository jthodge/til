# Use Relative Paths to Link to Wiki Pages from README

You can create a link from a repo's README.md to a repo's Wiki using relative paths.

Because a repo's README.md is located here:

`https://github.com/<user-name>/<repo-name>/blob/master/README.md`

And a repo's Wiki is located here:

`https://github.com/<user-name>/<repo-name>/wiki`

You can crawl up two levels from README.md to the Wiki:

`[Article Title](../../wiki/article-title)
