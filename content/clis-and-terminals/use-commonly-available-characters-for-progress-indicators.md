# Use Commonly Available Characters for Progress Indicators

Default to using the following characters when building terminal/CLI progress bars and indicators:

- ░
- █ 

They're available and work in terminals everywhere, so use them unless it's possible to guarantee a different font or ligature set is going to be used.
